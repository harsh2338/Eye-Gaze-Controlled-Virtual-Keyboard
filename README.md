# Eye-Gaze-Controlled-Virtual-Keyboard

### Tech Stack

- Python

### Installation

run the command `bash libs.sh`

### Description

Human computer interaction studies the design and use of computer technology focused on the interfaces between
people and computers. Eye-tracking technology can be used in many places as security, typing, tracking information etc. Many people are completely disabled, affected by diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Motor Neuron Disease etc, and cannot communicate with other people. This gives researchers the idea to develop a system for them to communicate or type information with the help of their eyes. This is a virtual keyboard that can be controlled by the direction of the eye gaze. It involves an application that detects human eyes, detects the eye gaze as left or right, selects a key or word when the user blinks the eye and navigate to a different screen by winking. The goal of this application is to type without using fingers, hands or, voice. Such types of application are really important and
blessings for those people who have completely lost control of their limbs.
